# Swamp Issue Skill

Fetch issue details, submit bug reports, feature requests, and security
vulnerability disclosures through the swamp CLI. When logged in
(`swamp auth login`), issues are submitted directly to the swamp.club Lab. When
not logged in, the user is prompted to log in or send via email. The `--email`
flag skips straight to a pre-filled email.

To view an existing issue, use `swamp issue get <number>` — this fetches and
displays the issue's title, type, status, author, body, assignees, and comment
count.

With `--extension <name>`, reports are routed to the extension's publisher
instead — either as a tagged swamp.club Lab issue (for `@swamp/*` extensions) or
to the publisher's declared repository (for third-party extensions).

To follow up on an existing Lab issue (e.g. add a related finding, link a
sibling issue, or update reproduction steps discovered later), use
`swamp issue ripple <number>` — this posts a comment ("ripple") on the issue.
`swamp issue comment` is an alias for `ripple`. Add `--close` to close the issue
after posting, or `--reopen` to reopen it.

**Verify CLI syntax:** If unsure about exact flags or subcommands, run
`swamp help issue` for the complete, up-to-date CLI schema.

## Commands

`bug`, `feature`, and `security` support interactive mode (opens `$EDITOR` with
a template) and non-interactive mode with `--title` and `--body` flags. `ripple`
takes a positional issue number and either opens the editor or accepts `--body`
directly.

| Command                       | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `swamp issue get <number>`    | Fetch and display issue details (title, type, status, author, body, assignees, comment count) |
| `swamp issue bug`             | Title, description, steps to reproduce, environment                                           |
| `swamp issue feature`         | Title, problem statement, proposed solution, alternatives                                     |
| `swamp issue security`        | Title, description, reproduction, affected components, impact                                 |
| `swamp issue ripple <number>` | Free-form markdown body (no title); alias: `swamp issue comment`                              |

**Basic non-interactive examples:**

```bash
swamp issue get 42
swamp issue get 42 --json
swamp issue bug --title "CLI crashes on empty input" --body "When running..." --json
swamp issue feature --title "Add dark mode" --body "I'd like..." --json
swamp issue security --title "..." --body "..." --json
swamp issue bug --email --title "Crash report" --body "Details..."
swamp issue ripple 184 --body "See also #183 for the related finding." --json
swamp issue ripple 327 --body "Fixed in latest build" --close --json
swamp issue ripple 42 --body "Re-opening per discussion" --reopen
swamp issue comment 184 --body "See also #183."
```

## Ripple Constraints

Ripples (described in the intro) have these submission rules:

- Requires `swamp auth login` — there is no email fallback.
- `--body` skips the editor; `--json` requires `--body`.
- The body is plain markdown; the server enforces a 65,536-character limit and
  rejects profanity.
- `--close` and `--reopen` are mutually exclusive. The ripple is posted first;
  the status change is a separate operation. If the status change fails, the
  ripple is still posted (partial success).

**Output shape** (with `--json`):

```json
{
  "issueNumber": 184,
  "commentId": "ripple_abc123",
  "serverUrl": "https://swamp.club"
}
```

With `--close`: adds `"statusChanged": "closed"`. With `--reopen`: adds
`"statusChanged": "open"`. If the status change fails after a successful ripple,
`"statusError"` contains the error message instead.

## Plain Submission Flow (no `--extension`)

1. **Logged in** → submits to Lab API → returns issue number and URL
2. **Not logged in** → prompts: log in now, or send via email
3. **`--email` flag** → opens email client with pre-filled subject/body to
   `support@systeminit.com`

**Output shape** (Lab submission with `--json`):

```json
{
  "method": "lab",
  "number": 42,
  "type": "bug",
  "title": "My Bug",
  "serverUrl": "https://swamp.club"
}
```

See [references/output_shapes.md](references/output_shapes.md) for all other
shapes (email fallback, extension-scoped, refusals, security variants).

## Extension-Scoped Submission (`--extension @collective/name`)

Routes reports to the extension's publisher. `@swamp/*` extensions get tagged
Lab issues; third-party extensions hand off to the publisher's repo (via `gh` or
browser); third-party without a declared repo refuses cleanly. See
[references/extension_routing.md](references/extension_routing.md) for the
routing matrix, examples, and refusal semantics.

## Security Routing

`swamp issue security --extension` checks GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting
(PVR) before routing — and refuses rather than fall back to a public issue if
PVR is off. See [references/security_routing.md](references/security_routing.md)
for the full PVR-state matrix and rationale.

## Bug Report Workflow

A state machine. Each state gates the next — do not advance until the current
state's **Verify** passes. If Verify fails, run **On Failure** and re-verify.

```
gather_details → version_check → submit → verify
```

### State 1: gather_details

**Gate:** None (first state).

**Action:** Gather bug details from the user — reproduction steps, affected
component, environment. For extension-scoped reports, confirm the extension is
pulled locally with `swamp extension list` — if missing, run
`swamp extension pull <name>` first. Note which source files you investigated
during diagnosis — you will need these paths in the next state.

**Verify:** Title and body are ready. Ideally you also know which source files
are relevant to the bug (for the version check in the next state).

**On Failure:** Ask the user for more details.

### State 2: version_check

**Gate:** State 1 passed (title, body, and diagnosed file paths are known).

**Action:** Check if the bug was already fixed in a newer version. Read
[references/version_check.md](references/version_check.md) for the full
procedure.

**Verify:** One of three outcomes determined:

- **bug_fixed** — the code changed and the bug appears resolved. Tell the user
  to run `swamp update` instead of filing. Do not advance to submit.
- **bug_present** — the code is unchanged or the bug still exists. Advance to
  submit.
- **inconclusive** — could not determine (source fetch failed, comparison
  unclear). Advance to submit.

**On Failure:** If `swamp update --check` or `swamp source fetch` fails, treat
as inconclusive and advance.

### State 3: submit

**Gate:** State 2 passed with `bug_present` or `inconclusive`.

**Action:** Verify syntax with `swamp help issue bug`. Run the command.

**Verify:** The command succeeded and returned an issue number or URL.

**On Failure:** See Error Recovery table below.

### State 4: verify

**Gate:** State 3 passed.

**Action:** Confirm the returned issue number / URL with the user (or relay
refusal guidance).

**Verify:** User acknowledged.

## Feature / Security Workflow

Feature requests and security reports use a linear flow (no version check):

1. Gather details from the user.
2. For extension-scoped reports, confirm the extension is pulled locally.
3. Verify syntax with `swamp help issue`.
4. Run the appropriate command.
5. Verify with the returned issue number / URL.

## Error Recovery

Map the failure to the right fix rather than retrying blindly:

| Failure signal                                  | Likely cause                | Fix                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lab submission returns 401 / "unauthorized"     | Auth token expired          | Run `swamp auth login` and retry                                                        |
| Lab submission times out or 5xx                 | swamp.club outage           | Retry with `--email` to fall back to email submission                                   |
| `gh` handoff errors with auth failure           | `GH_TOKEN` unset or invalid | Run `gh auth login` (or export a valid `GH_TOKEN`); re-run — CLI will retry `gh`        |
| `gh` not installed                              | Missing binary              | No action needed — CLI falls back to `method: "browser"` automatically                  |
| `status: "refused"` with "extension not pulled" | Extension not local         | `swamp extension pull <name>`, then retry                                               |
| `status: "refused"` with "no repository"        | Publisher declared no repo  | Do not retry; relay the guidance field to the user (points at publisher's profile page) |
| `status: "refused"` on `security` command       | PVR disabled on target repo | Do not retry as a public issue; relay guidance to contact publisher privately           |

## Requirements

- Lab submission (`@swamp/*` + plain commands) requires `swamp auth login`.
- Third-party repository routing uses `gh` CLI when available (`GH_TOKEN` env
  var or `gh auth login`) and falls back to browser handoff.
- Extension-scoped commands require the extension to be pulled locally via
  `swamp extension pull`.
