# Swamp Report Skill

Create and run reports that analyze model and workflow executions. Reports
produce markdown (human-readable) and JSON (machine-readable) output. All
commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.

## When to Create a Report

Create a report extension when you need a **repeatable pipeline** to transform,
aggregate, or analyze model output. If the analysis will be run more than once
or should be stored alongside model data, a report is the right choice.

**Verify CLI syntax:** If unsure about exact flags or subcommands, run
`swamp report --help` or `swamp model method run --help` for the complete,
up-to-date CLI schema.

## Quick Reference

| Task                     | Command                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Get a stored report      | `swamp report get <report-name> --model <model>`                  |
| Get report as markdown   | `swamp report get <report-name> --model <model> --markdown`       |
| Get report as JSON       | `swamp report get <report-name> --model <model> --json`           |
| Cap total output width   | `swamp report get <report-name> --model <model> --max-width 120`  |
| Cap column width         | `swamp report get <report-name> --max-col-width 60`               |
| Run method with reports  | `swamp model method run <model> <method>`                         |
| Skip all reports         | `swamp model method run <model> <method> --skip-reports`          |
| Skip report by name      | `swamp model method run <model> <method> --skip-report <n>`       |
| Skip report by label     | `swamp model method run <model> <method> --skip-report-label <l>` |
| Run only named report    | `swamp model method run <model> <method> --report <n>`            |
| Run only labeled reports | `swamp model method run <model> <method> --report-label <l>`      |
| Workflow with reports    | `swamp workflow run <workflow>`                                   |
| Workflow skip reports    | `swamp workflow run <workflow> --skip-reports`                    |

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Create the report file** in `extensions/reports/` — export a `report`
   object with `name`, `description`, `scope`, optional `labels`, and `execute`.
2. **Register in manifest** — add the filename to the `reports:` list in
   `manifest.yaml`. Verify with `swamp model get <model> --json` to confirm the
   report appears in the resolved report set.
3. **Configure in definition YAML** — add the report name to `reports.require:`
   in the model or workflow definition if it should run beyond the model-type
   defaults. Use `reports.skip:` to exclude reports you don't need.
4. **Run and verify** — execute a model method, then use
   `swamp report get <report-name> --model <model>` to confirm the report
   produces valid markdown and JSON output without errors.
5. **Check stored output** — run `swamp data query 'tags.type == "report"'` to
   verify the report artifact was persisted correctly.

## Creating Report Extensions

To create a new report extension, use the `swamp-extension` skill. It covers the
TypeScript authoring workflow, export contract, scopes, reading execution data,
and testing.

## Three-Level Report Control Model

Reports are controlled at three levels, from most general to most specific:

### 1. Model Type Defaults (TypeScript `ModelDefinition`)

The `reports` field on model definitions lists standalone report names that are
defaults for any model of this type:

```typescript
// extensions/models/my_model.ts
export const model = {
  type: "@myorg/ec2",
  version: "2026.03.01.1",
  reports: ["@myorg/cost-report", "@myorg/drift-report"],
  // ... methods, resources, etc.
};
```

### 2. Definition YAML Overrides (`reportSelection`)

The `reports:` field in definition YAML provides per-definition overrides.
`require` adds reports beyond model-type defaults. `skip` removes reports from
the defaults.

```yaml
# definitions/my-vpc.yaml
id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
name: my-vpc
version: 1
tags: {}
reports:
  require:
    - "@myorg/compliance-report" # adds to model-type defaults
    - name: security-audit # only run for these methods
      methods: ["create", "delete"]
  skip:
    - "@myorg/drift-report" # removes from model-type defaults
globalArguments:
  cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16"
methods:
  create:
    arguments: {}
```

### 3. Workflow YAML Overrides

The `reports:` field in workflow YAML controls workflow-scope reports and can
also override model-level reports for the workflow run.

```yaml
# workflows/deploy.yaml
name: deploy
reports:
  require:
    - "@myorg/workflow-summary" # workflow-scope report
  skip:
    - "@myorg/cost-report" # skip for all models in this workflow
```

### Filtering Semantics and Precedence

The candidate set is built from model-type defaults plus `require`, minus
`skip`, with CLI flags applied last. `skip` always wins over `require`, and
`require` makes a report immune to CLI skip flags. See
[references/filtering.md](references/filtering.md) for the full set composition
and precedence rules.

## Publishing Reports

Reports can be published as part of extensions via the manifest `reports:`
field:

```yaml
# manifest.yaml
manifestVersion: 1
name: "@myorg/reports"
version: "2026.03.01.1"
description: "Cost and compliance reports"
reports:
  - cost_report.ts
  - compliance_report.ts
```

For the full publishing workflow, use the `swamp-extension-publish` skill. It
provides a state-machine checklist that enforces all prerequisites before
allowing a push.

## CLI Flags

### model method run / workflow run

| Flag                          | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--skip-reports`              | Skip all reports (except definition-required) |
| `--skip-report <name>`        | Skip a specific report by name (repeatable)   |
| `--skip-report-label <label>` | Skip reports with this label (repeatable)     |
| `--report <name>`             | Only run this report (repeatable, inclusion)  |
| `--report-label <label>`      | Only run reports with this label (repeatable) |

### report get

| Flag                      | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--model <name>`          | Scope to a specific model                              |
| `--workflow <name>`       | Scope to a specific workflow                           |
| `--version <version>`     | Get specific version (default: latest)                 |
| `--variant <variant>`     | Select a specific forEach variant                      |
| `--markdown`              | Output as plain markdown instead of terminal-formatted |
| `--max-width <width>`     | Cap total output width in columns                      |
| `--max-col-width <width>` | Cap individual table column width in characters        |

## Report Data Storage

Report results are automatically persisted as data artifacts:

- **Markdown**: data name `report-{reportName}`, content type `text/markdown`
- **JSON**: data name `report-{reportName}-json`, content type
  `application/json`
- **Lifetime**: 30 days, garbage collection keeps 5 versions
- **Tags**: `type=report`, `reportName={name}`, `reportScope={scope}`

Access stored reports via data query (see `swamp-data` skill):

```bash
swamp data query 'tags.type == "report"'
swamp data get my-model report-cost-estimate --json
```

## Output

Three output modes: **log** (default, terminal-formatted), **markdown**
(`--markdown`, raw pipe-tables for pasting), **JSON** (`--json`, structured
detail for agents).

**Width controls** (log and markdown modes): `--max-width N` caps total output
width. `--max-col-width N` truncates individual table columns with `…`. Both
combine. Env vars: `SWAMP_REPORT_MAX_WIDTH`, `SWAMP_REPORT_MAX_COL_WIDTH`.
